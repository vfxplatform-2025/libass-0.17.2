        Thanks for filing an issue!
        To help us determine what's causing your issue, please take your time to read
        and fill out everything with as much detail as you can.

        If you're encountering the crash with an old version of libass,
        please retest with current git master or the latest release if possible.

      required: true

      label: libass version
      description: >
        What version of libass are you encountering this issue on?
        If you aren't sure how to find this out, give precise information
        on your player, its version and where you got the player binary from.

        If you uploaded a correct screenshot for comparison and haven't told us already,
        please also specify what renderer and which version of it gave you the correct result.

        Did previous libass samples render the sample better?
        Or is this a recent change (since when)?

      label: ASS Sample
      description: >
        Please provide a sufficient sample to reproduce the crash.

        At minimum this will be an excerpt of an ASS file; don't forget
        to include the relevant Dialogue and Style lines.
        The excerpt should basically be a fully functional ASS file in itself.
        If you can’t make an excerpt, we can work with a full ASS file
        if you tell us the time at which the problem occurs.

        If you see the problem only with a particular video file that contains subtitles,
        try to upload a short cut from the video file that we can play to see the problem.
        You can use tools such as MKVToolNix to make a smaller cut from a large file.
      placeholder: |
        If it isn't too long paste the ASS excerpt enclosed in triple backticks as below, or upload a sample file

        If a particular font is needed to see the wrong rendering,
        upload it as a zipped file inside the previous textarea if you have permission to do so.
        If it is a font freely available on the Web, you can instead give a link to it.
      options:
        - I uploaded or linked to the required font
        - The issue doesn't depend on a specific font

      description: >
        Tell us what system you're seeing the issue on (including the OS update level if applicable).
        If VSFilter and libass screenshots were taken on different systems, give the info for both.

      description: >
        A complete log and a stacktrace with debugging symbols is very helpful to find out what's going wrong.
        If you have logs regarding the issue please include them. Eg for [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv),
        you can obtain a log by adding `--log-file=output.txt` when playing the affected file.
